1,4.0,Former Employee,Immersion or Isolation?,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Abercrombie-and-Fitch-RVW31920.htm,"Jun 23, 2008",Assistant Merchant,"Columbus, OH","Abercrombie & Fitch provides an ideal workplace for recent graduates with aggressive career ambitions who are yet reluctant to surrender the familiarity and atmosphere of college.  The workplace is vibrant and frenetic, with high emphasis placed on individual responsibility, reactive strategy, cross-disciplinary teamwork, and brand integrity.  Most of the employees at corporate are well-educated, energetic, and--of course--quite good-looking.  Although workload varies on department and discipline, weekend work is rare.  Some opportunity for travel is available.  Finally, I must commend the Merchant Training program, which introduces new employees to the general structure of the business and gradually immerses them such that they can hit the ground running when they finally arrive at their desks.","A&F practices incessant brand immersion, which has its number of flaws.  Many of these are superficial: the A&F soundtrack plays throughout campus without pause, the entrance reeks of Fierce, everyone (except the designers) dresses completely in Abercrombie.  But some are not: conversation rarely extends beyond the subject of Abercrombie, all of the corporate employees spend time (read: party like frat stars) exclusively with one another, campus directs all attention inwards rather than out.  In other words, A&F breeds isolation, which can be detrimental both to personal and career perspective.

The other major problem is faulty relations between the business arm of the company and the creative side.","Generally, management at A&F is very strong.  Strategy at the highest level takes few risks--sometimes even when opportunity knocks.  Lack of brand differentiation leads to rampant cannibalization.",0,css-1areqgb,4,4,css-11rm5hs,positive,neutral,blank,7560,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Abercrombie-and-Fitch-Reviews-E6756.htm,

In addition, promotions are very subjective and dependent on areas/managers, etc, leading to uncertainty and decrease in morale when employees are expecting promotions.","I wish mid level management had much better training in leadership and team building. perhaps this is due to the fact that ANF does not give much weight to an MBA...much of mid level management has trickled up from entry-level positions.

3,4.0,Current Employee,A great place for entry-level grads looking to extend their college years,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Abercrombie-and-Fitch-RVW129147.htm,"Dec 7, 2008",Financial Analyst,"New Albany, OH","As an entry-level college graduate, you are given the opportunity to make an immediate impact and are giving a lot of responsibility.  My experience at A&F has been sink or swim--I wasn't formally trained in any kind of training program and was basically left to my own devices to learn my role and responsibilities.   There is a lot of turnover at A&F, with people leaving the company very often and with internal placements.  I had three managers within my first year, and given that I was still new in my role it was difficult to learn when I had to simultaneously teach my new manager what he was supposed to be evaluating me on.  Also, I am fortunate to work with a lot of really smart people.  They take your ideas seriously and treat you with respect as a young employee, which is something I do not think you would get at most other companies when you come in out of college.

Another great reason to work at A&F is the lifestyle at Home Office.  There is an on-campus gym with fitness classes and everything, so if your hours are flexible (not on the product side) you can go work out and take a fitness class or get in a workout during your lunch hour.  

It is definitely a unique environment with a collegiate, youthful feel.  If you are coming out of college and are looking to extend that lifestyle a few more years, A&F would be the place for you.","The collegiate atmosphere can be detrimental as well--often times professionalism is left to be desired.  It is not uncommon for employees to show up after a late night out, and not even try to disguise it, but also to share the prior night's events with the team (including their supervisors--it wouldn't surprise anyone if their supervisor had joined them).  It is not uncommon for employees to call in sick because of drinking.  People say in jest ""A&F takes college binge drinkers and turns them into alcoholics"" but it is often true.  There have been weeks where I've gone out for 5 nights in a workweek, relying on Red Bull and Excedrin to get me through the day.

Another downside is that HR doesn't seem to have it's act together when it comes to promotions.  They are struggling to find a fair way to give promotions in an economy where the company no longer has more money than they know what to do with.  This adjustment has been difficult company-wide, as the relentless focus on quality is so ingrained in every aspect of the business that most departments will spare no expense to make sure that Mike is happy.  There seems to be a resistance to change, and this stems partially from the arrogance of many seasoned A&F directors who were the drivers of the company years ago when it was still ruling the retail world with an iron fist.  I think this is also reflected in our merchandise--it's the customers' fault for not recognizing good merchandise, and not the fault of the teams who are responsible for producing it.","Senior management needs to start thinking more on a total company level, instead of each leader believing that their respective department is the most important department in the company.  Once senior managers and directors begin to realize this, they will be able to work cooperatively together to drive efficiencies and push results.  Often times common sense goes out the window....like having a spring preview floorset in the heart of winter.  Or having sizes that only fit toddlers or tweens with eating disorders.  There is a difference between being aspirational and being unrealistic, and at the end of the day, you are a clothing company that is trying to make money, not some kind of retail dictator trying to sell a lifestyle.  Many people at A&F forget this.",0,css-1areqgb,3,4,3,blank,negative,blank,7560,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Abercrombie-and-Fitch-Reviews-E6756.htm,

I admire the organization and standards the company puts forth in everything from the daily management program to guidelines such as the look policy.",The downsides of Abercrombie & Fitch are mostly from negative publicity and poor reputation.  Abercrombie's professionalism has been questioned and discredited in several ways because of this.  I feel as if Abercrombie salaries may be shadowed by other retail company's competitive salaries.  Another disappointment is to see lower volume stores in smaller cities not uphold the standards and expectations which the company desires.  I do not understand how District Managers can look at their stores and be okay with this.

1. The people. Especially if you've just graduated college, you'll be working with people mostly between the ages of 18-23, so it's nice working with everyone in your age group. All the people I've worked with have been great, and I've made many friends through the company.
2. Being cross-trained in multiple areas. As a manager you develop skills such as sales, leadership, multi-tasking, problem solving, and gain human resource experience from recruiting, interviewing and training. 
3. Advancement opportunities. Especially if you're willing to relocate, you can be promoted relatively quickly. There are also many home office opportunities beyond working in the stores if you're willing to move to Ohio.","The downsides of working for the company are:
1. Quality of life. The hours can be rough, particularly if the store is open late. At least once a week I have to close and then open the next day, which doesn't allow me to get 8 hours of sleep in between. You always work 5 days a week, even when there are holidays. It just counts as one of your two days off (i.e. Thanksgiving). The weeks when you are allowed to use vacation days are very limited, and I always feel like I'm upsetting my boss if I ever use a sick day. I rarely get a weekend day off. 
2. Ethics. Recruiting and hiring people based mostly on appearance when it's retail, not the entertainment industry, doesn't always feel so great.
3. Restrictions on relationships outside of work. Most companies promote employee bonding and offer many opportunities for it outside of the workplace. This company, however, has a non-fraternization policy restricting employees from doing anything outside of work with any employee that is above or below your specific position. It's one of the most common reasons why people are fired, if they get caught.","The turnover rate is so high with lower level management because of the poor quality of life, sub-standard pay, and the motivation to perform well lapses when positive reinforcement is virtually non-existent.

Management positions require a 4-year degree (any major) and little or no retail management experience. You will need to bring your good looks, sense of Abercrombie style (do not dress in other clothing for the interview), cool (or ""aspirational"") attitude, and intense desire to succeed in the workplace everyday. 

The company has a turnover rate among management of 99% - goal is 75%. It is said that there are definite advancement opportunities, and if you take the turnover statistic, you'll realize that you don't have to be the smartest or most qualified - you just need to be tough enough to be the last one left.

Health, dental, and vision insurance (recently added Q4 2008) is top-notch.

You will learn to become comfortable engaging any person in conversation. You will learn to manage a part-time team of 50+ store employees and adhere to strict deadlines. Employees receive a weekly visit from their District Manager and a quarterly visit from their Regional Manager. District Managers provide store-level management with constant feedback; which depending on your DM's personality will be very aggressive and tough, or will be very intelligent and straight-forward.

Working for Abercrombie will show college grads what it means to work hard and have fun at the same time.","Abercrombie & Fitch is lead in a top-down manner by a very driven man - CEO Mike Jefferies. Abercrombie & Fitch is his genius - and the policies and standards that are enforces have all been directly approved by him. A downside is that you will be forced by abide by the company's very strict ""Look Policy"" - meaning it governs more than how you 'dress', but also how you 'look.' All clothing must be styled a specific way, in certain colors, of the brand, and hairstyles, makeup, and nails also have restrictions. Great discounts are offered (40% Abercrombie, 30% Hollister - 'AAA' 50% discounts on specific outfits a week after seasonal floorsets), but you will be buying a few work outfits. Employees can, and are, disciplined and terminated for disobeying the ""Look Policy.""

As you invest more time in the company, you will begin to feel disconnected from the rest of the business world. I have seen many managers (store level and district managers) leave the company and struggle to adjust to the real world. Store management activities do not require that you calculate metrics - only two metrics are used on a regular basis (Sales Per Employee Hour & Shrink). Store Management is very automated and dumbed-down compared to other companies. You will be given daily tasks to complete with very in-depth instructions and deadlines. 

In many ways working for Abercrombie will also show college grads what it means to work hard, not smart. 

Store management compensation may seem low for a fresh college graduate, but compensation levels have risen in past years in order to become very competitive among specialty retailers.","I would recommend that senior management rethink the way the company shares ideas and information within the company. Their are many improvements and efficiencies that store managers are aware of that are not being implemented quickly enough.

Home Office (company headquarters) doesn't even post it's phone for customer complaints or customer service needs.  Managers just give out a business card with an email address.  All manager's jobs are evaluated based through very ridiculous standards which include: the District Manager's weekly audit, the Regional Manager's audit (which happens about every 4 months), Secret Shoppers' scores from their biweekly store visits, and the occasional internal audit by an employee of Home Office.  While these things often reflect the overall condition of a store.  They rarely, if ever, reflect the exact efforts of individuals working for the store.

I worked upwards of 70 hours some weeks and it was expected, not appreciated.  Associates feel guilty for working less than a 12 hour day.  The company expects associates to put the company first, their own well-being last.

- Poor senior level management.  Those who are up top don't know how to make decisions and their inability to either make a decision within a deadline, or their inability to stand behind their decisions are ultimately costing the company dearly.  There is a reason why the company is experiencing, to quote a yahoo finance article ""eroding profit margins"" and it is because numerous changes to financial strategy and to the product assortment and an unfocused and shaky big picture strategy for the future of the company.  This all stems from the inexperienced and immature senior management in the company.

- Corporate culture.  The company prides itself on hiring ""nice, young, funny, smart"" people.  They expect the campus to be a ""diva-free zone,""   Mike Jeffries should read the company creed again. He is neither nice, young, funny, or smart and he is the epitome of a diva.  The corporate culture is one of extreme elitism, based upon the notion that A&F is a ""cool and sexy"" brand and therefore, the associates who work there are also ""cool and sexy.""  This creates a corporate culture no better than the cattiest high-school.  Fraternization with co-workers is encouraged, meetings are often conducted like a fraternity or a sorority meeting including inappropriate side discussions and humor.","There is a reason why the company is suffering financial right now, it is because the associates are deeply unhappy and frustrated with the way the company is run.  Senior management needs to trust, appreciate, and nurture their teams so that they are able to contribute and be heard in meetings.  Product development should NOT be a merchant role, EVERY OTHER COMPANY has a production team so the merchandising team can focus on building a strong product assortment.  The split focus of merchandising an product development is just a cheap way for the company to combine 2 jobs into 1 to save money.  Trust the merchants, trust the designers, and hire people OTHER than college grads, maybe someone with a background in fashion and not just another pretty frat boy?  And to Mike and Chad, every change you make to the line has a financial repercussion and every change you make means dollars in the toilet and your associates have to stay that much later.",0,css-z2gtf,1,4,2,negative,negative,blank,7560,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Abercrombie-and-Fitch-Reviews-E6756.htm,

The brand reps (sales associates) were paid minimum wage and were not given very many hours. My main problem with this was that training process was difficult for brand reps because they would forget how to do basic tasks like run the cash register since it had been a week since their last 5 hour shift.  That combined with the low pay created a high turnover of employees making management difficult.  I would have preferred to have fewer employees with higher wages who worked longer hours.  

Managers are salaried.  You are scheduled to work 45 hours per week with a 1 hour lunch break, so plan on being at work for at least 50 hours per week.  You are discouraged from working overtime, and if you do you get half hourly pay (that is less than minimum wage).  During the holidays you are expected to work a 6 day week, without bonus or extra pay.  

One of the more difficult tasks is the recruitment part.  You are required to recruit people that come into the store to work there.  Specifically, attractive people.

If you don't have bills to pay and just need some extra weekend spending money or want to use the clothing discount, it's a great opportunity.

Once you apply, if you get asked for an interview you basically have the job. Interviews are a joke - They already know who they want to hire or not, usually based on first impression of your appearance. You have to really be an idiot not to pass the interview. They even asked me what kind of vegetable I would be. If you've got the looks and you purposely dress in head-to-toe HCO style, you've got the job.

Depending on your store, work can be really, really fun. Many managers treat associates more like friends due to closeness in age. If you're a favorite, you can get away with a lot. Personally, I loved the music, didn't mind the volume, love the scents and the clothes, so I didn't totally hate the time I had to spend there everyday.

My store actually was run well by the managers. It was important to get things done and not slack around too much (or at least multi-task and only talk to friends if you could work at the same time), which led to not too much drama or gossip, which I've heard about at some stores. I think that ultimately, your experience depends on your management.

There is a small discount (I think 15%), not for use on clearance items. You also have AAA's, which are specific discounted clothes chosen by corporate that are new. They want you to buy them in order to display ""the right image"" and to promote customers to buy the items. AAA's are usually more expensive items, so it's nice to get the discount once every few months. My store was not at all pushy about buying AAA's.

This is the perfect job if you aren't concerned about making a lot of money, don't need a lot of hours, and want a very easy, laid-back job where you can make friends.","If you are someone who doesn't like loud, LOUD music, don't even bother. Also, if you can't deal with listening to the same 20-30 songs on rotation for a month or two.

There is A LOT of favoritism, which can work out great or terribly for you. If you aren't someone with a very outgoing personality, don't go for model position (choose Impact) - You will feel ignored and will most likely spend all of your shifts standing at a table in a room alone.

Pushy taglines get old and usually are really awkward phrases. ""Cashwrap"" (cash register) can get irritating when the managers hound you about tags. The stores get secret shopped often, so you have to awkwardly harass shoppers in case they may be a secret shopper (for example, using the tagline ""Have you checked out our fragrances?"" when the customer is currently purchasing five fragrances. You will get yelled at for not using the tag, so just get used to customers looking at you like you're an idiot).

Speaking of idiots, the employees are not always the most competent, including managers. The store is very, very looks-based and almost all employees are in high school. Again, if you're young and just want to have fun, that can actually be a pro to have a not-so-serious job.

If you need a fast-paced job that keeps you busy, this isn't for you. Many days you will find yourself in a room for five hours, re-folding the same jeans over and over. I often had to LITERALLY refold the same shirts countless times just for something to do. Some days I would actually be excited to see a customer carelessly screw up the wall of jeans, 'cause I would finally have something to do after 2 hours of faking it.

Do NOT expect to move up professionally here. Pay is minimum wage, as far as I know there are no raises for associates. Hours are terrible, I had great availability and was one of the few lucky employees to get about 16 - 20 hours a week!

All associates are part time. Only managers can work full time, and you must have a college degree to be a manager (actual degree does not specifically matter - I had managers with business, political science, etc). However, managers work their butts off and tend to have no lives.","Given that this is a high school oriented store with high school employees, it's basically run the way it should be. I would however highly suggest raise opportunities for associates who are devoted and work many hours (myself being an example, I worked usually every day of the week and covered many shifts with no complaint). I quit this job for a better paying one, but wished I could have stayed. I was one of few truly hard workers there at the time. Employees like these should have incentive to continue working hard for the benefit of the company. I also would suggest programs and encouragement for employees approaching college or college graduation to be prepared and trained for management. Using motivation and the right incentives, I could see HCO easily convincing employees entering college to go for a business/management degree, and move up upon graduation. However this would probably have to come with a nice raise too for sticking with the company for four years as well as being promoted. I don't know specifically what managers made, but I recall mine making comments about barely paying their bills. I think that if HCO developed programs and opportunities for growth, they could get rid of the negative reputation caused by their high turn over rates.",0,3,1,1,css-z2gtf,negative,blank,blank,7560,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Abercrombie-and-Fitch-Reviews-E6756.htm,

Management experience (although of limited scope) and management training (although of poor quality).
Fun coworkers in your own age group (20-30 years of age).
Flexibility in terms of location with great re-location opportunities.
International opportunities (although few and hard to come by).
Acceptable first job right out of college.","**Don't expect to learn anything of actual value while working here. The job requires a bachelor's degree but don't let that fool you. A monkey could do this job. If you can read a recipe to bake a cake then you can also be a manager here -  all you have to do is be able to follow instructions. Independent/critical/innovative/creative thinking is neither required nor encouraged.
**Obnoxious work environment plagued by the following: loud music just barely within OSHA standards, dusty and heavily scented air, and a dark and insufficiently lit work environment.
**Exploitation of workers. The company actively endorses high turnover since the CEO Mike Jeffries consistently wants ""fresh faces"" in the stores. This policy quite likely stems from the corporate realization that it is the only way to maintain morale (somewhat) as disillusioned workers soon realize that this job is a joke. The high turn-over is a pain in the ass for managers who constantly have to train new people while trying to maintain the operational integrity/efficiency of the store. Not to mention how detrimental the turn-over rate is to creating a positive corporate culture including moral values and loyalty to the company.
**Unethical practices. Cowardly and non-confrontational managers frequently simply omit company pariahs (""undesirables"")  from the weekly schedule in the hope that they will quit the job due to not getting any hours (when there is no legal basis upon which to fire the unwanted associate).
**Systematic violation of work rules (break times, hiring practices, and vacation). This is of course not endorsed at the corporate level but nonetheless employed at the local (store) level through an implicit don't-ask/don't-tell understanding.
**Company policies that, although not illegal, certainly are unethical.
**This is a superficial company that only seems to value easily brainwashed employees that happen to have a favorable genetic composition (good looks). This is further emphasized by the complete lack of faith in the hired managers' actual managerial skills. Everyday, a company program prints across that needs to be followed to the tee and every task or assignment needs to be signed-off on. This is to effectively rid managers of any urge to use their own brains. The company attempts to conceal this obvious disempowerment and dumbing down of managers by ascribing an exaggerated importance of meticulous attention to detail (especially visual detail). By keeping people focused on details, they don't see the big picture, I suppose.
**Poor training with a high degree of on-the-fly learning and occasionally unclear job expectations. If you, like myself, were placed in an under-staffed store, you can expect to be required to complete the manager training program at the same time as you are learning to run the business. Needless to say, not much thorough training is ever done. This is later often thrown in your face though phrases such as ""lack of dedication"" and ""laziness"" when specific details are accidentally over-looked (due to improper training).
**Corporate atmosphere of threat-over-incentive application of leadership.
**Extremely poor ROI on investment of time, loyalty, and effort into the company - you are either promoted or weeded out over time (and promotions don't grow on trees).
**Non-existent expression (implicit or explicit) of appreciation for employees.
**Extremely high turnover - mostly caused by low job satisfaction.
**Pathetically, customers often get better discounts than the associates working for the company. Yes, you heard right! In addition, associates are restricted from taking advantage of customer discounts. Yet the company stands dumbfounded as to why internal theft is so high.
**External theft (regular shoplifting) is ridiculously high due to farcical loss prevention tactics. Meanwhile, significant time, money, and effort is spent suspecting/vilifying employees for theft and associate discount abuse. This is absolutely ridiculous considering that all an associate has to do to steal is to instruct a friend how to get away with it (since stealing as an employee is considerably more risky/difficult than stealing as a customer).
**I felt sorry for a lot of the employees that had been with the company for a long time without anything to show for it (no raises or added rewards/bonuses/benefits/tokens of appreciation).
**The level of incompetence in management is sometimes mindboggling. Semi-intelligent mangers get out before fully corrupted and turned to the dark side. The remaining mangers (needless to say, NOT the best and the brightest) are the ones competing for advancement.  Exceptions obviously exist, though rare.
**Due to a previous class-action racism law suit in 2004, the company is mandated by court to strive for more ethnic diversity in its hiring practices. While this may be intended as a good thing, it sometimes leads to reverse racism. In addition, the company still hires people with a very narrow and specific physical appearance in mind. In practice, I can't describe it in any other way but to say that the company wants essentially white people with a very slight tough of ethnicity (read: color) - or, described differently, people with diverse ethnic backgrounds but with STRONG caucasian physical characteristics. A few exceptions (read: dark-skinned individuals) are of course thrown in for good measure and to keep up appearances. I am, for example, YET to see any marketing (advertising, primarily found in the store itself) with a dark-skinned model. 
**The main criteria for advancing in the company is... recruiting. That's right. Not people management. Not operational management. Recruiting! Clearly, it is considered so difficult to consistently find enough unsuspecting souls (enough to make up for the high turn-over) to work for this unscrupulous company that they have made this the single most important factor when being considered for a promotion. In other words, in order to achieve long-term success with this company one also need to be adept at selling and deceiving.

In summary, almost all intelligent and conscientious individuals that I have come into contact with through this company thinks that this company is a perverted joke! Most put on a content face solely for the sake of keeping their job. For the great majority, this job is a temporary one in a tough job market. The remaining  people I have come into contact with are frightening examples of what the US work force has to offer: easily brainwashed and manipulated, non-critical, take-orders-like-in-the-military drones with an unsatisfyingly low capacity for critical thinking. 

In order to genuinely appreciate this job one has to be either stupid, desperate, or willing to be misled/deceived.","OMG! Where should I begin?
For once, show some appreciation for the employees  - they make up the store, including the store experience. Disgruntled employees make terrible promoters of the brand.
Listen to the employees. They are extensions of customer sentiment and hear more direct customer feedback than HQ ever do.
Employ some REAL management education so that poor management tactics (such as threats, punishment and implicit unethical expectations are replaced by real incentives and rewards).
While internal theft is considered to be high, you wouldn't have to worry about this nearly as much if you gave your associates reasonable discounts (i.e. better-than-the-average-customer discounts).",0,2,css-z2gtf,css-z2gtf,2,negative,negative,blank,7560,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Abercrombie-and-Fitch-Reviews-E6756.htm,

They have really great health insurance - it made me hang around a month longer than I originally thought I could. The fact that it's paying makes it a little better (although, I don't feel they pay us enough for what we do). 

It is a full-time job with great benefits which is, most would agree, hard to find in this economy - you only have to work with them for 30 days until benefits kick in. 

Music and store smells of fragrance (if you like that sort of thing) 

Another plus about being full-time: since I'm often scheduled and have to work 41+ hours a week and I'm in California I actually get time and 1/2 (unlike the other states who's pay gets cut in half once they reach 40 hours! Anyone at 41+ hours a week gets their hourly pay cut in half, usually meaning their working overtime for less than minimum wage - I don't even know how that's legal!) Hey, I guess California actually protects it's citizens in some ways.

Extremely casual - although at times too casual.

Hired based on looks (and the fact that I had experience made it that much better). Yes, I can be shallow, I know, but I think that's part of why I got hired too...

Only requires a Bachelor's degree, no experience needed. Although I did have experience and that made getting the job easier.

It's a really easy job although it can be stressful and/or overwhelming at times, and on the other end extremely boring at other times... not too much in the middle.

It was a really good experience. I have NO regrets - this experience has taught me I would only accept a position with this company again if I were staving to death.

Met some really great people (although unlike the people in the reviews before me, I would never stay there years for ""people"")

Putting in 2 weeks soon","There is too heavy focus on recruiting!!! Also we have this diversity scorecard to make sure we are hiring enough minorities for front room associates and management... but the biggest thing was don't just hire and minority you have to hire ""great looking"" minority - they have to be ""cast of"" meaning so freaking hot we would actually ever consider letting them breathe the same air we breathe. We can hire A FEW of ""us"" if we're average looking but if the are minorities they better be ""cast of"". So... in response of the lawsuits, managers must take on the additional tasks of - on top of all the other stuff they already have us doing - having meetings around who's ""hot"" and where are we going to find ""hot"" people, taking a valuable asset off sales floor, a fully trained manager, and having them search the streets or local college campuses for more ""hot"" people, and spending our off time thinking about and actually looking for ""hot"" young looking people!

The music is SO loud and the fragrance is strong that some days you will walk in and get headaches (if you don't like that sort of thing). Plus customers will complain about it which will only make you feel worse. 

They trick you during your training period thinking things will be a little less stressful - the first three months they have you following the store manager's schedule and you really only work 5 days and really have two full days off. Then I switched to my schedule... I have to go to an 8AM management meeting every Tuesday. I only get one full day off! (Friday) and I wake up at 6/7AM on my other off day (Tuesday) to go to a management meeting when I closed the night before and didn't get off until 11PM. I'm trying to do everything I just learned the past three months except I'm trying to do it sleep deprived - especially since it's nearly impossible to balance work/personal life - even with their two full days a week off, my coworkers barely do it.

Irresponsible Employees

Most employees are really young, naive, and others are just annoying - there are really only a few that are truly wonderful. I had one employee today who complained about how tired HE was.. he was tired of standing or something, Not to mention, this employee is NEW... he works 1 to 2 times a week for 4 or 5 hours. Are you serious kid? Grow up!

Extremely rude customer base, then we get ""disciplined"" because we're not showing enough customer service. If a customer were to spit in our face they would want us to wipe it off and keep smiling. Some people list the employee discount as a con but it's really not. The redlines/clearance items are generally much cheaper than anything that's full price using our discount, since we can't used our discount on clearance prices. They generally treat the customers better than employees. (Which is why they focus much more heavily on internal loss prevention versus external loss prevention).  Also these people have such lenient return policies that I have to return merchandise from 2008 - I'm not kidding.

You have to be the manager, the janitor, the maintenance man, the merchandiser while being the loss prevention agent, the loss prevention agent, the model, the impacter, and a recruiter. The models and impacters will always complain to you about their minimum wage salary although there is NOTHING you can do about it. They don't even begin to understand that you don't even make 2 times more than they do yet you're expected to do 3 or 4 times more work, meaning the work of 3 or 4 associates at 1 time. We don't want to not tell you our salary because we're afraid you'll get mad at us..we don't want to tell you because it's embarrassing.  A manager does the work of many people. Phone sales employees at cable and phone companies make the same amount of money as we do, if not more - and they get paid to do one thing: sale (plus they get to do it sitting down, not wearing flip flops that are bad for your feet - at least that's what the chiropractor said).

Standing for 8/9 hours a day. 9 hours: if you stand the whole time you're there. 8 hours: if you sit on the office floor, on a box full of receipt paper, or on a step ladder because there isn't a break room and there isn't any chairs. (One of the higher managers actually asked what we needed chairs for.)

After months of working here I was sooo afraid that this is how all jobs were or how all jobs would be. I was SO relieved when my aunt told me that this is far from the truth.","CONS CONTINUED:


I had the TERRIBLE experience off switching from one DM to another. My old DM was okay, I could deal with her. This new DM is, oh boy... she's nice but she's so ""Abercrombie"". While my old DM's focus was running the business well, my new DM's focus is making sure we have ""great looking"" people and ""great looking stores"". She will always want you to be in full ""look policy"" even if the store is closed and it's only your jacket that's not Abercrombie. Truthfully, I don't know if she would have hired me. A few months before the switch, I bought some items (which I ran by the store manager first) and started wearing them to work - it was important because I didn't own any Abercrombie before I started working there. Shortly after meeting my new DM I was informed many of the items I had been wearing were not appropriate - never mind that I had been wearing those items for months and I had confirmed with the store manager it was okay to wear those items to work BEFORE buying them. I'm now left with limited options from my very small Abercrombie wardrobe and non Abercrombie plaid. 

Work/Life balance is really hard. Looking at the other managers who have been there longer than me, I can only assume it will get harder. It's not very flexible and they will change your schedule whenever they need you. They want you to live to work not work to live. I have worked in a 4 manager store for 6 weeks now and only 1 of the weeks have worked a 4 manager scheduled.  Most of the other weeks, one of our managers got borrowed at another store. Yet when we feel we need to borrow someone, there is no one available to do it. 

Vacation Days, sick days, and personal days are rationed out... so don't get too excited about that unless you KNOW you will be able to survive the first 6/7 months. You will be overworked, underpaid, and working with one day off for at least 3 months straight while watching your coworkers take paid days off - meanwhile you're burning out waiting for days to accrue.

It's stressful and getting time off is like a circus trick.. switching that day and taking that one - not to mention... that occasional time... you'll have to work a week in a row, then wake up on your off day at 6am to go to the 8AM meeting after closing at 11pm the night before, and then work two more days before finally getting your full off day.

This job is boring! superficial and sometimes just plain busy work like in high school.

Bag checks - one day another manager dug a little too far in my bag... don't know what they were looking for,. 

The sad part is the best part of this job is supposed to be that it's so cool. Abercrombie prides itself with the fact that people want to be involved with the company because people feel it will make them cool. They should just work for the fact that they work for a cool company and just ignore the mistreatment, being underpaid and notably underpaid. 

ADVICE: 
We're your in store employees, the foundation of this company plus we're customers too, treat us like it!

Keep expanding internationally... that's your best bet.

A break room with chairs would be nice.

It's so sad... how much happier managers could be if Mike Jeffries were not so greedy!

A raise is overdue. I guess I would be out of touch with what it really takes for an average person to live if I could feed 5 countries for 10 years too.

Turn down the music, I like my hearing. Go easy on the fragrances, I like my lungs.

Those management meetings need to alternate seasonally or something. One person being the only one who gets just one day off for MONTHS is just wrong.

Give our associates more than minimum wage it makes them happier, plus sometimes their work truly does deserves it. Plus it would make our job easier if they stayed around longer.

I want to keep my personal life and I will fight you to the death for it! That's why I could never see myself moving up in this company.

I need a challenge not the challenge of trying to figure out stupidity though.

They think because they come up through the stores, they have more of advantage then people coming in from the outside with 15 years of experience.

In my three years with the coming, I watched the manger of my department get promoted 3 times over that span while only 5 associates out of 50 in our department got only 1 promotion! 

Also, ANF tries to promote that same style as you see on their stores, so associates were expected to wear current ANF clothing line to work. Since there clothes sizes are so ridiculous, it is hard if not impossible for people with weight issues to wear ANF Clothes. I heard Mangers asking their associates why they were not in ANF clothing even though they knew damn well that person could not fit into ANF Clothes. 

When the lay-offs occurred in 2009 while the CEO was getting over 60 Million dollars in compensation, it was almost a given that a lot of cuts were based upon age. Not surprising that when the lay-offs occurred, that out of 11 people with the same job title, the two that were let go were the two of the oldest and both did not fit the ""Abercrombie"" look.

the general attitude of the associates that work their is very elitist, their sense of entitlement if very deplorable. I know they are in the Fashion industry, but it was obvious from the start the ""pretty people"" were the ones going to get ahead in this company. This pretty people mentality is very evident in the higher practices in both the home office and in the stores.

You are paid very well and depending on your department the people are pretty nice to work around. The campus is pretty awesome and it is definitely one of a kind.","While they offer some great packages, it is like working in a fraternity or sorority. If you do not act or look a certain way, you tend to be out casted. It is not this way in every department just some of the more brand image departments such as merchandising, allocation and brand senses. You also have to understand that you are working for a single person's vision. While they try to emphasis team work, it's not really true. This company will be made or broken depending on what one person believes in. It's kind of hard to get on board and follow a company like that.

Promotions are based on who you know and who you can suck up to as well. Unfortunately I was stuck in a department that ostracized you if you did not fit the correct mold. Myself being married, older (28), living in a suburb and not going out to drink every night, did not bode well in my department. Everybody lived in either downtown, short north or German village and with other A&F roommates. Everybody goes out with each other including senior management, if you don't get in with this crowd you will be out for the remaining time you're in the department. This crowd also tends to get favoritism. A slap on the wrist for someone means termination for a different person. This company is a huge clique. It is honestly like high school all over again, except it lasts the length of your career. 

You are also expected to work incredibly long hours. For people who want a life outside of A&F without other A&F associates in it, don't work here. You also aren't thanked for your long hours, and in fact if you actually do leave on time (between 530 and 6) it is severely frowned upon. Don't expect to have much of a home life.","Treat everybody fairly, that's your job as senior management. You shouldn't be hanging out with only certain lower level associates, giving them better treatment while chastising others. Stop the horrible clique cycle A&F has.

(You are probably a highschool student if you're an associate, and thus keep in mind you are at the bottom of the totem pole.)
you get awesome discounts
you work with beautiful people
you hang out with these people even outside of work
you get to help people through customer service
you develop an understanding of retail, like color classification, shoplifting prevention, upselling, how to manage stock and inventory, how to organize and display clothing, etc.","The cons are these:
you most likely will be making minimum wage
the managers have favorites and will give the favorites better hours
no texting! (this could be a pro)
you are eventually pushed into buying their clothes (and you're *almost* required to wear them for the shift) which are expensive because Abercrombie is higher-end for highschoolers
you can only advance from associate if you get a 4-year degree. you then can become an MIT (manager in training) before becoming an assistant manager.
the music is upbeat but loud, making it hard to communicate on the sales floor.
the perfume they spray is strong but you will get used to it.","Allowing associates to earn small pay raises could help with recruiting. Beautiful people are not always smart people. Giving the associates small projects to work on will keep them from getting bored and it will help you get your list done for the day. by telling the associates what to work toward, you'll get better store scores and we'll be able to impress secret shoppers. tell us the motifs behind all the things we perceive as 'silly,' like 'hey what's going on? welcome to abercrombie!' or the catchphrases we use at the register. if we understand why it's important to use them then we're more likely yo use them when we get secret shopped, and then you'll get higher scores, which makes you look better as management.",0,4,3,css-z2gtf,3,positive,neutral,blank,7560,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Abercrombie-and-Fitch-Reviews-E6756.htm,

Prettiest girls always got promoted to SM the fastest.  DM often threw temper tantrums.  There were unrealistic expectations for store experience -- upper management demands perfectly board folded, size stickered stacks of clothes and yet we never have enough budget hours to accomplish everything.  You will at times feel like a janitor, as we have to direct the usually teenage models to clean the store before open (1 model can't possibly clean a huge store in the 1 hour before open so the manager usually has to do half of it).

We lost over 200 units a week due to theft (we were a Target store) and yet company refused to give us LP agent to help.  The handicap fitting room didn't even have a lock on it!  People would sneak back there and pop sensors off the clothes and there was nothing we could do about it except give them ""great customer service.""  What a joke!   You would think they would at least lock up the fragrances but they are out everywhere in a dimly lit environment, ripe for the taking. Yet you will get yelled at for out of control shrink. 

The people can be great, especially other managers, but the models and impacters are oftentimes spoiled high school/college kids who routinely forget to print their schedules and don't show up.  Many of them try to do as little as possible, so it is a constant battle to make them do anything.  Turnover is extremely high, managers quit all the time and so do part-timers.  This is endlessly frustrating because by the time you are able to finally train someone they leave.  And who can blame them -- the beautiful people we are supposed to employ usually can find jobs that pay more than 7.50 an hour.  Managers are underpaid relative to other retail companies.  Also, expect to be inundated with never ending gossip about who is hooking up with who, and endless rumours in general.

Work life balance can be difficult, especially if you are visual manager (and then expect to work 6-4am during floorsets and updates).  I average about 9 hours a day (with 1 hour unpaid break that is mandatory).   Expect to work all holidays and nights (night shift is from 2pm-11pm).  Getting a full weekend off is rare.

Prior to being promoted to lead stock, I was part time impact. With that position, there was a lot of flexibility with scheduling. The company also allows relocation with gaurenteed position at new stores which has come in handy with my several city changes. 

Once becoming full-time: the benefits ARE AMAZING! I only now wish I would have taken full advantage of them as I've yet to find as good of a package for such a low rate. 

Granted I was not a manager, I was granted the management discount which was awesome!

While the egos of many part timers can be overwhelming, it has a fun culture. It also help build a strong confidence in both myself and everything I stand for. While some took this confidence boost to their head, I feel it helped give me that competitive edge.

Despite it being hectic, as most retail is, it can be rather laid back.

I also enjoyed the music and the dress code.","Oh boy, where to start?

I was once very dedicated to this company and wanted to advance as far as I could. I valued Mike Jefferies and idolized his ideal in running a business... Then I woke up and saw Abercrombie for what it was worth. Talk about slap to the face.

Abercrombie focuses more on looks than properly running a business. While they have that classic American beauty image to uphold, the quality of employees suffer as they will select an interviee with far less to contribute to a store that looks good vs. someone who has more than the world to offer that looks above average. Many part time employees, esp ""Models"", take the job as a joke and fail to equally contribute, even though they are getting paid to do a job. Oh the rants you hear on a daily basis by these kids. Yes it pays you min. wage, but find a job in the mall that doesn't. Yes, it gives you poor hours, but again, good luck elsewhere. Those on a full time level have to BUST their tales on a daily basis to make up for the slack that reoccurs every day, every week, every year. I luckily was a non-exempt employee therefore I LOVE OVERTIME PAY :).  Management turnover is also very high, which leaves for a chaotic work environment. Of the three years I worked for the company, I had at least 25 different managers, which does include management at all levels not just Store Manager. 
District managers, and this is all three that I have dealt with, do not value anyone other than the store manager. They have little respect for anyone, which humors me as they were once working in that position some years ago. I could go on forever..","Value all of your employees. It takes an entire TEAM to create success. Employee turn-over is high, there is a reason and that can be addressed. Also, don't keep useless managers as they drive away those with true potential. I have seen store after store fail for similar reasons. Look deeper into employee motivation as the company as a whole needs to improve the moral of a majority of their employees. In wanting to be selective in hiring, select a pretty face with brains- it isn't as hard as it sounds.

73,1.0,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Worst treatment towards Managers EVER,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Abercrombie-and-Fitch-RVW1653382.htm,"Jun 26, 2012",Visual Assistant Manager,,"Abercrombie does give a good, easy segway into a management position, as their hiring standards for Managers in Training are not very strict- you do no require management experience, just a Bachelor's Degree. So for someone fresh out of college it is a good starting point for a full time job with benefits, and they do start you at a decent salary given the economy (or they did two years ago when I was employed, things may have changed since).","Abercrombie treats their managers horribly, when they are so essential to the success of the stores! There are three types of Assistant Manager you can become when you ""graduate"" the training program (which they do not hold strictly to- MIT's can easily cheat and are often given the answers or don't even end up doing the actual training activities because they are needed as extra register ""ringers"" because they do not count as the same type of hours alotted for the day): Impact Manager, Peoples Manager or Visual Manager. Admittedly, the first two are not so bad (with only one or two closing shifts each, and always a weekend day off), but if you are the lucky one to be made Visual Manager, you have officially signed your life away to the company. As VM, you are basically a second overnight manager- you have only one or two opening shifts and rarely get a weekend day off. It is extremely rare that any of the other managers, who always have the same schedule, will switch with you so that you can get a weekend day off and live a normal life. You work either overnight from 5pm-2am or in a non-overnight store, from 6am-2pm, often without getting a lunch break because there is no one to cover you. You are often in the store alone at scary and dangerous times. You cannot leave a floorset or update until every single detail is met and everything is finished- which often takes up to 12 hours to complete. I managed a team of overnighters who spoke minimal English, and was once there from 5pm until 10am the next morning- and only paid half-rate for overtime hours. You are not allowed to take off time to compensate the extra hours worked- you just keep working and still only get paid half of your normal rate for any hours exceeding the 40 per week expected of you. You also are constantly denied requests to use your alotted vacation time. Or even to take time off due to an injury endured in the workplace. 

Abercrombie's hiring standards and claims of diversity are also completely false- they instruct managers to dissuade ""undesirable"" applicants from applying in the store kiosk, because the only numbers they base their hiring percentages on are the ones from applicants in the kiosk (versus online or interview walk-ins). They tell applicants that are not ""Cast-Of"" to apply for the impact position versus the model position, where you have to meet a certain look and standard (beautiful, thin, etc.) They recruit to fill gaps in diversity not to be a genuinely diverse company, but to meet their quotas so they don't get in trouble.  

Overall Abercrombie is a completely unethical company that treats its managers and employees like slaves.","My advice to Management is to treat your Managers better- they are running your stores! Make the schedules more fair, and pay time and a half for overtime hours like a normal company should- not half time pay. A college graduate should not be making the same as a 17 year old after a certain number of hours are met. Grant your managers the vacation days they request and deserve! Create a way for the Visual Manager responsibilities to be shared, and be fair in your hiring! Also, I was personally mislead and told constantly ""You're our best Assistant Manager, you will be promoted so quickly you're a rising star"" etc. and they kept delaying my promotion because I didn't want to be Visual Manager anymore because of the extreme work hours- be fair!

~Overtime at the company is another laughing matter. Instead of getting paid time and a half... abercrombie managers get paid HALF time so if you make 14 an hour, overtime would be 7. And you better believe you will work overtime, especially if you are a visual manager or if someone important is coming into town (regional manager,etc). 

~ The company standard is really high so there are ridiculous expectations for managers without any sort incentive asides from looking good on paper. Also, the store isn't given a lot of part time associate hours so its not easy to maintain the standard.  85% of the managers are so lazy that it's usually one manager doing most of the work which can get so frustrating.... that's what happens when you hire managers based on looks rather than skills. But managers are expected to do everything from recruit, interview, hire, thoroughly train associates, to ensure that the store looks PERFECT at all times, including the stockroom, to make sure that anywhere from 10-50+ boxes of shipment (depending on the volume of your store) get done and are put up in the stockroom, to dealing with customers and associates and all the issues that arise, to walk around the store to make sure that no one is stealing, to daily meetings with each associate, etc etc etc..... there really is a lot to it and i could keep going. All of that would be fine if the pay was better. Oh and while you're doing everything, you are also being completely micromanaged because everything you do has a detailed list or description of EXACTLY how they expect you to do it. 

~ That brings me to the next point, the company is SOOOO shallow. Managers and associates are all hired based on looks. The best looking associates reap the greatest benefits which is really unfair. Managers have a recruiting goal where they have to go out and recruit associates and other MITs... aka go up to attractive people and tell them to come work for the company. Interviews are only there for HR purposes because as a manager you can tell if someone will get the job the second they step in the store, it doesn't matter what they say. If you aren't attractive, you can try applying for the part time Impacter position and you MAY be able to get the job, however, it has gotten to the point where the district manager will have an issue even if you hire unattractive impacters. Leave your morals at home if you want to work for this company. If you recruit or hire someone who your DM doesn't think is ""abercrombie standard"" not only do you get yelled at but he or she will make you ""weed them out"" by not scheduling them until they quit. It's sad. 

This is getting a little too long, so I will end with this. The company is DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA all the time. The people that get hired for management are generally just out of college (21-22 year olds) who really have no real world experience. Most are ridiculously immature. Abercrombie makes it a point to have managers recruit MITs who are involved with frats, sororities, sports, etc... so as you can imagine, work can sometimes feel like high school. There is always some sort of gossip going around, some kind of drama, and if you're lucky like I was, even your DM will act like a high school drama queen along with the rest of management. Not to say that everyone was bad, we had a lot of cool, chill managers too, but mostly immature, dramatic ones.","~First off, make the pay competitive, there definitely would not be that much management and PT associate turnover. No one wants to do THAT much work for so little pay. 
~Stop hiring based on looks alone, if you hired smarter, harder working managers, it would definitely pay off in the end & if you paid more, then you'd have more people willing to actually work there and wouldn't have to resort to hiring the first pretty face that walked in the store.",0,4,3,3,2,negative,negative,blank,7560,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Abercrombie-and-Fitch-Reviews-E6756.htm,1

Coworkers make it bearable.,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Abercrombie-and-Fitch-RVW1827840.htm,"Aug 9, 2012",Model,"Toronto, ON",- Fun/friendly co-workers and managers,"- Just about anyone can do this job. Independent/critical thinking is neither required or encouraged.
- Loud, heavily scented, and an extremely dusty environment.
- Company endorses high turnover rates, which means company loyalty is non-existent.
- Employee appreciation is almost non-existent as well. This contributes to the low job satisfaction.
- Uneven distribution of hours. The ""unnattractive"" people get less hours because they are not ""cast-of"". There is absolutely no seniority for the veterans at my store. I feel bad for the people who have been at this store for so long with absolutely nothing to show for it.
- During the interviews, they tell you its optional to buy the AAA seasonal outfits. In reality, if you don't purchase them, you don't get scheduled. I've overheard the DM call our store to tell us our percentage of employees who have bought AAA's, and the percentage we need to achieve. This type of implicit coercion to buy company clothing is ridiculous considering the following point;
- Customers often get better discounts than the associates working for the company. In addition, associates are restricted from taking advantage of customer discounts. Yet the company remains dumbfounded as to why internal theft is so high.
- External theft (regular shoplifting) is ridiculously high due to stupid loss prevention tactics. Meanwhile, significant time, money, and effort is spent suspecting/vilifying employees for theft and associate discount abuse. 
- Violation of work rules (ie. breaks, hiring practices). Not endorsed at a corporate level, but is thoroughly practiced within stores by the implicit don't ask/don't tell understanding.
- Store is always under-staffed in order to cut down on hours available for employees to work.
- This leads to constant complaints about long line ups.
- The Eaton Centre location has 2 sets of cashiers, and 2 fitting rooms, yet even with long line ups, the 2nd set of cashiers are never open and the 2nd set of fitting rooms are not much better.
- This company favours placing all time and effort into meticulous attention to detail (such as lights and forms/mannequins) rather than customer service. (I was given a poor performance note for helping a customer with a pair of jeans near the top shelf in Womens 1, when my DM told me to ignore them/call someone else to help them, forcing them to wait, and remain at the tagline station instead)
- Which leads me to my next point, the company has set up useless rules which do not promote customer service/convenience such as;
-- Misleading/confusing marketing
-- Not able to hold clothing
-- Never/rarely opening more cash registers/fitting rooms
-- Constantly understaffed
- This is all due to ridiculous secret shoppers who spend their efforts picking out useless faults such as a light burned out, not being able to smell the cologne enough, a size sticker missing or a clothing item unfolded. 
- The bottom line is the company is more about protecting their presentation and outdated image rather than retaining quality employees and providing sufficient customer service.","- You guys are doing a horrible job, its no wonder why the company is sinking fast. From approximiately $80/share in the market to now approximately $30/share.

Cool managers and assistants, it is really a ""what you make of it"" and ""what can you put up with"" kind of job. 

International Opportunities if you are willing to sacrifice your personal values, or just don't care about people.","Schedule is horrible, the notation of a set schedule is rare in the A&F world these days. 
High turnover with managers and associates, both can be related to compensation, and scheduling. Managers working over 40 hours do not get OT, they get Half Time, so basically its less than national minimum. So this creates a poor environment for people who want to get extra work done because they are not going to be compensated fairly. Then if you are a Salaried Manager, SM, you are that, they will expect you to work in excess of your 45 hours, or even work 6 days! The hours given are bare bones, you can get the basics done, but you are expected to go way beyond that so hours always are a concern. But don't ask for Bank hours from your DM, because they wont give them out, they want to get their bonus check at the end of the year for not using them! COMP days- for working holidays, okay, but not given to all managers. Annual raises are once a year, and range from 3-5-7% but really no one receives a 7% unless you are the most fantastic recruiter in the company,
So that brings up Recruiting, ""Staff your stores with beautiful people"" that's why customers come and shop at A&F and Hollister. I still find it hard that any one believes that, the only people who come for that reason are young teens, and they don't spend money, its their parents. Who will then complain constantly about the music volume and the vulgarity of the imagines on the marketing and bags. The Obsession with recruiting is astonishing, yes you need to have the staff to run your store, fair. but when your ""Beautiful"" associates know that is why they got hired it makes it difficult to motivate them, and keep them around for more than a few months. Then at Any Level of the hiring process for Managers, Part time Models or Impacters you are being hired based on your appearance. Don't hold this against the person who is doing the interview, they are only trying to do what they are told. Because if you hire that one associate that will be awesome with customers and work their tail off for you, but is not ""like models in the marketing"" you ill be questioned and then reprimanded for it. Side note- your budgeted hours for PT Associates is broken down to serve half(50%) to your Cast of Models. Looks, not work ethic will determine the hours you will be able to delegate to your associates.
Your customers are always going to be a pain in retail, so that is expected, but the company doesn't offer much support. Customer Service is an email address that rarely gets a response, so that puts Managers in a bind because we generally want to be helpful and this will cause us to bend the rules to help the customers. So constancy is hard, and then if you help that customer it could cost you your job. 
Culture is a word that is thrown around alot at A&F, its is fabricated more so than anything, because each location is expected to follow and represent the same values and culture, but the company is world wide and you can not realistically respect that. Then the discrimination that is present within the company is where i see the biggest issue. Just remember if you are getting into the company remember two things, BE Beautiful and Recruit (and have the nerve to hire using discrimination as a tool). That will be the formula for success, intelligence or creativity will not be rewarded or acknowledged. 
Your experience is always going to be different based on who you work for, but all direction is coming from the same place, so do not expect much, especially when movement of personnel within the company is often.",,,1,4,2,2,negative,negative,blank,7560,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Abercrombie-and-Fitch-Reviews-E6756.htm,1

-Can have a flexible schedule, depending on if your SM/GM doesn't care JUST about themselves.

-No experience needed. 
-Every once and a while you'll see that one article that you really like because it reminds you of what AnF and Hco used to be like.","-EXTREMELY under appreciated.
-The amount of work expected is work more than minimum wage.
-In a round about way you actually are expected to wear the clothes, but they get around it by saying the current cut style, fit and colors as long as its not any other brand..which no one else makes muscle fit clothes for guys. 
-Expected to do a lot of physical work in attire that isnt physical work friendly. Like having to wear skinny jeans a tucked in tee and a button up while having to move 50 boxes.
-The required look doesn't always fit with the weather. For instance its 105 degrees outside and once again having to wear skinny jeans, a tucked in tee and a button up.
-While some of the music is great, you sometime are stuck with an awful soundtrack for up to 3 months which plays over and over and over.
-Unless you're really good at sucking up or your DM likes you, don't count on being promoted unless a time of desperation happens. Like store managers all quitting at many stores at once.

-The company takes itself too seriously. 
-Stores are being shut down left and right in the US while over seas they're being open every week. I think someone has'nt learned a lesson. Trends are just that..
-Not very keen on trends. More so for guys. The guys clothes have been basically the same since I was in high school in the early 2000's.
-You can not live alone, and have a social life with what the company pays managers. 
-Home Office associates more often than not,haven't worked in stores in so long they can't relate or understand to help with the problem you're having in the store.
-Micro-managing does not work with everyone and the company calls it ""follow up"" 
-No differences in the brands. What you see in AnF you will find at Hollister and Gilly Hicks with a different logo. 
-Very promotional sales based. The clothes show it. IE.. 2 tees for 20 and so on.
-Incentives for certain things are candy boxes for associates. 
- You get 50% off on two tops and a bottom with each major floorset. Including managers who have to wear it 40-50 hours a week. A month in your current ""look"" is faded and stretched out from washing it so much. The flip flops break often and you only get 50% off on those one a year.

I went home, attempted to apply for my original job as a floor model, only to find that it said I was still in the system.  As soon as we got that figured out, I finally started working again, but they gave very few hours to me because they didn't know how long I had worked there before.  Around January, my hours dropped significantly.  Apparently, they had put me back in the system as a seasonal employee without letting me know.

- Call-Ins. After working for companies that doesn't have a call in system (you call in one hour before your shift and if business is good/it's busy they will ask you to come in), it's comforting to know when business picks up you have the help you need and associates aren't there long after close. 

- Your work atmosphere is fun! As long as your doing something you can have fun doing it. For example, you can run from room to room dancing if you're putting items away. The playlist may not be your favorite music but I guarantee you can't go a shift without to a song. The majority of managers I've had are nice too.

- There is a three month long MIT (Manager in Training) program that helps coach new managers on running the store. 

- More on hours. Like all aspects of life (including work) favorites are played. If you work hard or are ""liked"" by managers you will get more hours.

I've definitely made a lot of friends working here, and at least my store being the smallest tier it is really laid back and if you are on the managers good side you can pretty much get away with anything minus stealing from the store.","The pay is awful, and raises only happen like once a year and in my experience they weren't really given to ones who deserved it.  It seems they favor models over impact for raises even though impact definitely does much more work.  Girls usually non-stop talk/gossip which should be expected but just be careful of what you do when it comes to going out, meeting up, or doing anything outside of work with co-workers especially those of the other sex.

I'm about to blow up the terrible pay also:

I know of no store manager within my region that gets paid more than $40k annually.  Assistant managers get paid about $28k, while head store managers seem to make about $35k.  Was offered a position as a manager but after I had talked to mine I realized it was totally not worth the hassle and stress.  Management positions within actual stores seem to be the worst positions you can work in.","Stop giving regional positions to unqualified personnel.  My DM went to school for fashion or some garbage, and thus is terrible at actually managing the people that work under her.  She has little to no people skills and is viewed as extremely fake because she doesn't know how to manage people, ends up criticizing everyone's work while never explaining why what they did was wrong, the importance of why that needed to be done right and generally treats everyone below her as a stepping stone for her performance to move further up within corporate.  Actually, it seems that is a general procedure of corporate: taking advantage of everyone within the retail side to maximize profits and your employees on this side notice that and genuinely feel used, and disenfranchised because of it.",0,5,1,1,4,positive,neutral,neutral,7560,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Abercrombie-and-Fitch-Reviews-E6756.htm,3

The employee handbook says they won't require you to buy the clothes, as long as you have something similar to the current look and display no competitor logos. However, I've heard our DM say if associates don't buy the new look (which changes 3-5 times per year), they are not to be scheduled. There is a minimum number of new recruits they want each month, which is fine except it takes hours away from experienced associate and often, those old associates end up training new kids because the managers are busy trying to get their own tasks done. Most associates get three (on average) 4- or 5-hour shifts a week so there is a high turnover rate. It's a difficult company to move up in unless you start off as a manager. You need at least a bachelor's to enter the MIT program. So even if you are a dedicated worker who has put in numerous years (in my store there were at least four of us who were past the 5 year mark) and had no write-ups or customer complaints, you are basically stuck in the entry position. You may get to move up to lead stock, but only if your store feels like setting aside the hours for that position. The company focuses heavily on diversity and non-discrimination but it's not hard to find a list of the lawsuits A&F has been involved in. I will admit though that that issue is more because of the shady values of some individual managers so not every store has that problem.

- friendly co-workers and supervisors/managers (in the main)
- soft attendance policy IMO.  You have to work hard to get fired for poor attendance.
- discount at AF, Hollister, Gilly Hicks, and kids stores
- recently went to a four day workweek (10 hr. shifts), which gives you a three day weekend 
- on campus gym
- I've seen complaints about the home office HR, but the HR team that handles the distribution centers is great, very helpful and responsive in my experience","- They've started farming out a lot of work to a temp agency, which keeps their costs down and our wages low
- high supervisor turnover rate. My supervisors have lasted, on average, less than a year before they quit or are rotated out.  They rotate supervisors constantly, and many don't last very long because of the hours.  This is bad when it comes to getting your annual reviews and raises.  It also means you often know more about your department than your supervisor.
- Senior management.  They tried to consolidate everything into one DC, encountered all kinds of problems, and the hourly employees paid for it.  The difficulties meant we lost our summer (2012), working six days a week for nine straight weeks.  The point man on the consolidation ""left"" the company, and they decided to keep both distribution centers.
- During the Christmas season and summer you will be working a lot of OT weekends.  So if you like spending time with friends and family during the holidays or those summer weekend nights, forget about it
- low low low pay.  The starting wage when I was hired many years ago was $9.30/hr.  It's still $9.30/hr.  Warehouses all over central Ohio have raised their base pay, but not AF.
- mind numbingly repetitive job no matter what department you're in
- dirty and very noisy work environment.  Lots of atmospheric particulate matter - you blow your nose at the end of an 11 hour shift and the discharge is black
- The jobs I've had have been physically demanding, and after so many years you are worn out.
- I work only in the distribution centers, but from what I've seen of the corporate home office (HO), they hire relatively young and good looking people, work them until they burn out and leave, then replace them with someone else relatively young and good looking, then repeat.  They have a high turnover rate.  The CEO has said he likes to hire employees close to the age of their target customer, and the grueling hours the HO employees work seem to be part of the strategy to keep a young work force.  Either that or a young HO work force is an unintended consequence of the hours they are expected to work.  The HO people that I've encountered have all been very nice.","less supervisor rotation, across the board rate raise is long overdue especially considering the fluid production standards",0,2,2,2,2,negative,neutral,neutral,7560,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Abercrombie-and-Fitch-Reviews-E6756.htm,3

This is a) nearly impossible and b) no way to actually run a business.

As for professional development, it is what you make of it. If you make a conscious, individual effort to learn logistics and management, then it's possible that you will. However, the company doesn't actually evaluate their managers based on running the store, but on how many 'approved' models they recruit. Because of this, your store manager (and probably district manager) will be hopelessly inept and you will spend a lot of time cleaning up after them or enduring their awful scheduling and management mistakes. (They were promoted for their recruiting skills, NOT their management abilities.) I was literally told, word for word, after my 6 month interview; ""You're doing great on all the stuff we talked about here, but.. honestly, none of it matters. Just get more approvals.""

Because of this single-minded focus on recruiting, customer service is extraordinarily bad. The company doesn't care about the customer experience, so no customer complaints are followed up on and you as a manager have no power to fix difficult situations. So your 'customer service' experience will be completely limited to just hearing irate mothers scream at you about your horrible policies and store atmosphere every day and being able to do nothing whatsoever for them.

These kinds of decisions explain why the company is doing so poorly financially, and they show absolutely no sign of being willing to change. And finally, when I turned in my notice that I would be leaving the company, I was fired two days into that notice. After consulting other former managers, this is apparently the norm for A&F; a sort of ""you can't leave us, we're leaving you"" response. That last event in a very long line of unprofessional conduct confirmed that I had made the right decision.",,0,2,2,3,1,negative,negative,negative,7560,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Abercrombie-and-Fitch-Reviews-E6756.htm,1

It's located on beautiful grounds in Ohio (the occasional deer is visible from your window at work). You have tremendous exposure to all aspects of merchandising from the very beginning and you present directly to the CEO after only a few months. The base salary is what an average family makes in Ohio and if you're good, it can grow quickly. And after about 2 years, you will have the ability to travel to the factories that make your garments, most are located in South and East Asia. The food in the cafe is pretty good and there are exercise facilities directly on the premises (though I never used them).","In their brochure they tell you it's a ""diva-free"" zone, which to anyone with a brain should mean ""there are a ton of divas here."" Why else would they make such a statement. 

As a merchant, you are at the center of everything and responsible for everything. Which means, you will always be the first person to blame when something goes wrong in the very long and complicated supply chain. You are responsible for every part of design, costing, planning, production, transportation, and sales. It's truly too much work for any one person and there used to be more jobs (usually two people for one brand) before they cut jobs in the recession.  

Your manager will decide your life at Abercrombie. I was unfortunate to get truly one of the worst (and there are a lot of bad ones). There is no training on how to manage there, it's just the person personal style. Some people are awesome and some are terrible. This person will decide himself or herself if you are good or not. Also, shakeups happen all the time. People get moved too often and it disrupts teamwork. 

The worst thing is that even in the rare case you succeed (they hire so many people not because they are growing, but because so many new people quit after their contracts are up--and some pay out their contracts to quit beforehand, even in a recession) you likely won't last for long. As the CEO is whimsical and he treats people like the clothes themselves, what's hot today is tomorrow's trash. So the higher you go up the chain, the more likely you are to be lose your job. My terrible manager prayed NOT to be promoted, because he feared the extra responsibility and losing the job stability of being on the bottom. 

Overall, it's a good place to get some experience right out of college, but only a very small percentage make it a career. It's meant to beat people up until they quit, so they can hire new ""Fresh and young"" faces,which keeps the brand closer to the target age. If you are over 30 at A&F, most likely, you are not in merchandising. It's impossible to be a merchant and have a family, as you work about 11 hours on average a day, can it be more, and ten is the minimum they ask every day (8am-6pm) is the best you'll get.","Management knows what the problems are, but they keep things this way because the whole place is designed to weed out people to keep the place full of ""fresh eyes"" for the clothes.

Anyone who is seriously considering working for them, this will be a factual account of what it is like. I worked part-time all over Oregon and CA for five years (high school-college), and went from MIT-AM-SM in 1.5 years. 

-If you are halfway intelligent, you will immediately realize it is not hard to run these stores. Everything you need is provided by a giant manual regarding policies (so no creativity allowed) for operations, and another huge binder for anything visually related.  If you are ""great looking"" i.e. very naturally beautiful or handsome (think fashion model type of look) you will move up faster than someone who is far more qualified to run a business than you. You will be tired from standing and walking all day wearing flip flops. Tip: Wear the style of shoe they allow and place insoles in them. It will absolutely save you, and make you better able to enjoy what you're doing.  You will be expected to ""recruit"" attractive people daily whether it be in the mall, or at a local college campus, and have interviews bi-weekly to interview people you already know youre hiring anyway.  You will have DM (weekly) and RM (bi-monthly or quarterly) visits that will not want to discuss business strategy, or cost saving methods, hours, people development, or basically anything business related.  As long as you have ""cast of"" quality employees (best looking) you can run way below sales plans and still be promoted and praised. 

-There will be a lot of difficult employees to work for.  Winey managers at times, winey sales staff, people not showing up for shifts (be smart, youre hiring high schoolers and college kids so expect this from time to time and be ready to set a clear expectation from the start), and stockroom kids (impact team) that steal, slack, and also do not show up.  This is where you can become an excellent leader of a future company. You will learn do deal with these things, manage them, execute terminations, one-on-ones, motivate troubled employees into hard workers, etc. Many are unable to do it. Focus on your strong managers development, know which other managers can't cut it (being able to recognize who doesn't really want to be there to develop their future skills, and are just using this as ""full time job with benefits"" is one thing to work on), let the high turnover kids (part-timers) float in and out in their natural Crombie cycles. 

-If you can be seen as a fair, friendly, cool, hip boss that can get their work done, have tough conversations, and still act like a gentleman..Your store will run itself and your staff will smile and have fun. People want to work for leaders like Ive just described.   

-You will probably resent the company after some time.  The miserable pay for the amount of hours and work you put in will anger you. Lack of recognition from superiors on excellent work you are proud of will upset you, when they only want to discuss recruiting beautiful faces. These are the times to manage your own stress, and learn about your own style, stresses, and how to overcome them. Holidays, thanksgiving, sales, black friday, etc will all beat you down. You will be micro managed. Learn how to manage this. 

-Oh yeah, they actually do have nice benefits insurance wise. I always thought they were trying to keep turnover low with this.

-In summary for Pros: if you're in high school or college, want to have fun, work with good looking people, and have a nice way to find parties, this is great for you! Otherwise, work somewhere else. If you are able to profile people and have no problem sorting out ""normal"" people from ""amazing"" without ever feeling mean or cruel, you will do great here!","-There honestly are too many cons about these guys to list. Some you cannot turn into a positive. The sadness you see on peoples faces when they ask for a job when your DM tells them ""we're not hiring at the moment"" then makes a snide remark about them as theyre walking away, still able to hear whats going on is heart breaking.  All DMs I worked with (at least 12 over my entire career with them) were like this.  

-Seeing all your best, hard-working, money making employees hours forced cut time and time again by your boss because ""she is better looking and needs to work more"" is impossible to comprehend in a profit center. That was what did it for me.  

-This company is a dying trend in the States. Stores are constantly closing here. Internationally yes, they are doing alright for the moment (think China).

In addition, the benefits were comprehensive.","The hours and pay suck--I worked weekends and nights as an impact assistant manager, so it was nearly impossible to have a personal life outside of work. The company also treats their employees poorly and has terrible values. I was frequently told to only hire attractive people for part-time and management positions. The company does not care if people are hard-working or reliable, just that they ""fit the look"". It's a revolving door of employees as the company pushes recruiting very hard, but then makes no effort to retain employees (during my 10 months there, I saw 6 managers quit). Furthermore, the company has obviously been hit hard with the recession (and with their declining popularity in general) as they gave stores barely any hours and are STRICT on each store hitting their required hours exactly. You will get your ass handed to you if you go over, even an hour. For instance, on busy Saturday afternoons, we would typically only have 3 associates working at a time and 2 managers. Since everything in the store must be ""perfectly"" folded, this made it difficult to close the store within the hours budgeted and according to company standards. Having so few associates at a time and ridiculous policies also made for angry and frustrated customers. 

You're not technically required to wear the company's clothing, but as a manager, I was pretty much forced to purchase and wear the company's clothing to work. It wouldn't have been a problem if I had received the clothes for free, but I only got a 40% discount, which sounds like a lot... But when you don't make that much, the clothes are expensive, and they have new looks every two months, it is a lot of money. 

The company has ridiculous policies and standards across the board, and it has dumbed down the manager's role so that a monkey could do it (a checklist for the day would print out every morning from corporate). Overall, it was a terrible experience for me.","Treat your employees like people. Retail jobs in general have bad pay and hours, but make it up to employees by giving them other perks and treating them well. It will pay off in the long run.

When I first started I felt really welcomed and everyone seemed more than happy to help me out when I needed it. The discount is also really good, you get 50% off of five items every season and the rest of the time you get 30% off. The work isn't hard, usually doesn't get too stressful, and once you get used to standing on your feet for hours on end time passes pretty quickly and it can even be enjoyable and fun at times. It's a really laid back place to work (where else can you wear denim shorts and flip flops to work everyday?) and they are really flexible with scheduling. If you're in school or have other commitments A&F is a great company to work for because it's super easy to change your availability and also give away/trade shifts with other models.","The environment isn't the greatest to be working in for long hours.

You do get used to it to a point where you can tune out the music and don't really notice the cologne, but it's still not the most 
enjoyable environment to be in. 
Also, the store can get insanely busy sometimes (I've seen the line to cash almost reach the front door) and that means dealing with a lot of angry customers. It gets really frustrating sometimes, and while most of the managers are great, I have had a few managers who seemed really bad at managing the store properly when it got too busy and it almost seemed like they didn't care.

The raise was/is not based on how many years you've been with Abercrombie or how loyal you are, not even on how many hours you dedicate to the store per week- its based on how CLOSE you are with management. In addition, Abercrombie likes to overview the term ""Store Model"" when hiring associates. Some people get so excited over being called a ""Model"" that they accept the $7.25 pay, when we are forced to do more work than $7.25 can compensate. Management will also go out of their way to make your life a living hell if they don't like you, and NO ONE lasts at Aber.

-The stores are fun to work at, lively and have a good vibe about them.
-It is a clean and easy job.
-Management is not expected to fold clothing and we have freedom to do what we wish in the stores.
- Abercrombie stores are everywhere, thus transferring locations is very easy.
-Associate discount can be up to 40% for full time employees.
-Great medical benefits!
-The stores are very tight knit and everyone is friends with everyone.","-A&F has a tendency to harbor shady management on all levels of the company. The turnover rate for management is absolutely incredible, and 90% of the turnover is due to firing of management (internal theft, dishonesty, sexual harassment, discount abuse). You name it, I've heard it. 
-A&F is not competitive with wages and salaries. ALL part timers are making minimum wage and management is making among the lowest retail management salaries in the industry.
-The company is failing incredibly profit wise. Both Ruehl and Gilly Hicks (A&F owned brands) have folded in a three year time period. I do not see A&F being around 10 years from now with the same facade, type of clothing or company goals.
-The time frame for promotions from store management level to district level or home office level vary greatly. I've seen equally qualified store managers get promoted to a higher level in a 2 year time period, while it's taken others up to 6 years. Favoritism and physical appearance are the only factors in promotions within A&F.


Overall, A&F has been good to me, with some major drawbacks. I am overall very pessimistic about the future of this company.",,0,,,,,blank,blank,blank,7560,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Abercrombie-and-Fitch-Reviews-E6756.htm,

High school drama between adults and favoritism present among lower and upper management. Home office provide you little to no support when you were trying to call them. Human Resource and Payroll departments never answer your phone call and always prompt you straight to voice mail no matter the fact that you have an emergency that need to be resolved in minute. Sometimes I wonder if the people working in that department actually get paid to do anything? DMs get brainwashed by the Home Office and forget their days as a Store Manager. 

Pay is among the lowest retailers while our CEO was named the most overpaid executive. And yet the standard and expectation are ridiculously high. Half pay for any overtime which is extremely discouraging. The turnover rate is soaring high that manpower become a significant concern and yet they couldn't even admit the main cause for the problem. And then they blame it on the lower managers for ""not being able to train and retain people"" so that they can use it as an excuse to make us constantly recruit for college grad. How could I recruit any beautiful good looking smart and intelligent college grad with nothing good to offer for them? Discount? Tried that, but I'm sorry your employee discount suck.

Upper Management does not have your best interests in mind.

My new District Manager did not like me because I voiced my concerns to her and defended my associates and managers. She wrote me up for insubordination for two separate incidences, both of which I had witnesses for, all who stated that I was in no way insubordinate. I filed an appeal to the disciplinary actions to HR. HR never contacted the witnesses I supplied, instead the investigation consisted of HR contacting the Regional Manager (who made a total of 2 trips to my store over my 1 year period as SM at this location), and decided between themselves to uphold the actions. I had attempted to contact my RM to discuss my concerns with him via phone and email, never did he once return my call or respond to my emails. I was essentially blacklisted from the company once my new DM decided she did not like me. 

In addition to the insubordination write-up I was given, my DM also wrote me up for poor performance. Never was it stated what areas I was lacking in. My store was in fact bringing in a higher revenue that the previous year and was selling a higher volume of units as well. When I compared my store metrics (based on our secret shop scores, interal audits, DM audits, etc.) to the other stores in my same district, my store was far from having the worst scores, yet I was the only one being put on this probationary period. 

Simply stated,this is not a company you want to work for. The immoral practices of the upper management and HR to the crap that comes out of the CEO's mouth, there are just too many reasons why not to waste time with this company.

Micro Management

Bad pay

Long hours. Especially holidays. Store managers get paid salary- work 10-12 hrs/day on average. They get days off in exchange for overtime. Assistant Manager gets paid hourly. They get paid half of their hourly salary working overtime. Although you will never ever work less than mins 42 hours/week. You will accumulate days off but requesting time off is never easy. They never want you to leave work.

Work-life- not balance ( shift 6am-6pm sometimes longer if your upper manager wanted to surprise you with a visit, 8pm-4am--- very irregular schedule)

Management team, upper management will not have your back unless you're store manager or higher. ( mostly because they cant afford to fire someone that sticks around for that long)

Stressful day

Upper Management visits store often- one problem- never give good compliments to all the hard work. but instead critique you more until your self esteem is as low as possible - Biggest reason for HIGH employee turnover rate ( Part or full time)

Hypocrite

Many things more.

As a store manager, I have had DM's tell me that an Assistant Manager wasn't handsome enough to get promoted, even though he was a great manager.  The company does not value hard work, only how you look.  Also, you can only hire people who meet company ""image"" or you will get yelled at by your DM.

-Healthcare benefits getting worse every year.  Co-pays for doctors visits are now $30, they used to be $20.  Deductibles have gone up as well.

-Forced to buy new clothes every 3 months.  You get 3 items 50% off which is still expensive.  The rest of your discount is laughable.  40% off FULL priced items only.  Customers get better deals than you 99% of the time with sales.  Other retail stores give their employees 75% off or free clothes every season.

-Horrible hours.  You will work weekends, weeknights, holidays, etc.  The time you are allowed to use vacation days is very limited due to blackout periods.  Calling in sick can be impossible due to staffing shortages.  

- Horrible pay:  Assistant manager make around 30k a year, and store managers around 36-40k depending on how large the store is.  Very non-competitve with other similar companies.  Long overtime is routine and you will not get paid overtime.  Overtime is HALF pay, i.e. minimum wage anything over 40 hours a week.  No bonuses, no commisions.

- Horrible upper management.  Impossible expectations with limited resources.  Budget hours keep getting cut, you never have enough people to meet the store standards.  Regional Managers are usually rude and have adversarial attitude with store management.  And you better not complain!!  Everything, no matter what, will somehow be your fault.  DM's are hit or miss.  Some are better than others.

-Irresponsible employees - it goes without saying that working with teenagers who tend to be unreliable can be stressful.  Many no-shows for shifts and bad attitudes (they are only making minimum wage).  Some great employees however.

- Management in-fighting.  Due to the stress placed on managers by DM's and RM's, there tends to be a lot of blame shifting that goes on.  This is not always the case, but I have seen a lot of managers throwing other managers under the bus.  Some fellow managers are awesome, however.

- Should I go on?  Most managers will quit within 6 months.  Turnover is extremely high.  Given the above list, is that any surprise?  There is a poster in the office which reads, ""Remember, there is always someone waiting in the wings to do your job better!""  Basically, you are disposable and replaceable.  The company does not care about store-level employees.

It's more of a place to work to make friends to party with out side the job. The vaca/ healthcare benefits are good compared to others in the retail industry.,"What the CEO says goes. CEO Mike Jefferies micro manages this whole  company. When mike comes to visit a store in the field a total make over is done to the store he is visiting( costing a ton of payroll hours). Mike has never seen how a real store runs and operates. I'm talking fake workers are gathered from local modeling agencies and the entire store gets refolded every night before he comes. If only CEO mike knew what a store really looked like with the limited payroll hours they are budgeted to use and how bad the part time staff is when they get paid $8 an hour but have to buy very expensive outfits to wear to work. Often workers are sent home because they can't afford to buy the clothes to wear and you have to in order to get scheduled shifts. 

Managers are salaried employes who work well over 50 hours a week( and don't get good pay for it). 

If you want to work with great looking, cool, fun people this is your dream job. If you like to get paid fairly for the long hours and hard work you put into the job this is not the place.","Advice to senior mgmt:
Let the CEO  see what a real store runs like daily not after you dump a ton of payroll hours into it to fix the issues.

Stop requiring a 4 year degree to work for $30,000 as a retail manager. 

Stop promoting managers based on how great looking they are instead of how smart and hard working they are, promote based off results.",0,,,,,blank,blank,blank,7560,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Abercrombie-and-Fitch-Reviews-E6756.htm,

Securing a position at one of the top brands in retail provides a strong base for career development. Opening a new store with A&F is a great experience in management, particularly when dealing with foreign contracts and a variety of languages around the site.
The facile interview process is both a pro and a con due to questionable recruitment policies.","The culture of diversity and inclusion at A&F tops off a farcical, and frankly laughable, attempt at shrouding their reputed controversial recruiting policies. Whilst fitting the criteria may ensure a fast-track through the interview process, this often leads to under-qualified managers and trivial, mundane daily tasks as a result of having to train everyone on an equal level.
The working hours & time-off policies are antisocial, with a working week invariably including at least one 5am start and one 10.30pm finish. A review of working hours resulting in a weekly rota would be beneficial.
The target-based assessment is often flawed in countries outside the US due to disrespect for foreign culture and trends. Little research into national holidays, buying trends and customs leads to daily/weekly targets being often miscalculated, meaning targets are often vastly incongruous with actual business.
The lack of challenge is directly related to the rigid management structure. A prohibition on use of initiative leads to stagnant progress and a lack of motivation.
A huge employee turnover is a result of poor micro-management and the implication of strict rules that do not necessarily translate from the US system.
Incredulous outsourcing of store maintenance; with European technicians coming solely from the UK, and standard parts ordered exclusively from the US, the response time, and general severity of common problems is exacerbated. 
Lack of trust and respect towards non-English speakers goes directly against the A&F policy of diversity and inclusion. The attitude of various members of senior management is questionable in the slightest.","Allow managers to use some initiative... 
Review working hours - why not allocate the early AM starts and closing shifts on a weekly basis, to allow managers to have a slightly more regular sleeping pattern. 
Drop the anally-retentive 'standards' in place of some basic employee respect. If the same amount of time and energy went into ensuring the happiness and professional development of staff, the workplace would be far more pleasant and, in turn, reflect positively on the 'customer experience'; a value at the forefront of the A&F brand. In place of this, the current uninterested, sour and superficial way of dealing with employees is invariably reflected throughout the store. Senior management needs to seriously reconsider its policy of recruiting 'aspirational' managers... or perhaps review their idea of 'aspiration'.",0,1,4,2,1,negative,negative,negative,7560,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Abercrombie-and-Fitch-Reviews-E6756.htm,1
