One small down side the the importance that upper management places on bonuses being used to supplement salary.

An american company with a long history of success. Financially strong company that doesn't falter during tough economic times. Products are best in the industry, hands-down. Benefits are excellent and pay is competitive.  Business knowledge gained is fast and broad.","Job descriptions are grossly skewed and managers are expected to both be a sales rep and a store manager.  This is a salary job where you will easily work 50+ hours per week with no overtime. You're assistant manager can make or break you and the remaining staff at stores are typically part-time. If you're real lucky, you'll get an untrained ASM with no staff, open 7 days a week and no 3rd key to supplement long hours. No other company will you find an $7 hour part-time employee helping a $250,000 account on a daily basis.
Sales reps on average; do nothing except complain because stores weren't  ""giving"" them accounts.  When problems arise, reps are no where to be found, except on the golf course.  DM's were typically sales reps in their previous position and are ""pro rep"" on every issue.  It is always your fault.  I have also seen two DM's leave the company on ""not so good"" terms only to return a year later and be re-hired in their same position.  There is a ""good old boy"" organization still in existence but has some what been covered up with their new ""diversity"" movement.
System methods and pricing are redundant. In 11 years of employment, SW has not been able to fix these ""very important"" issues and you will be challenged by every customer regarding the price on products.   You will constantly feel like Monty Hall in making a deal over every gallon of paint you sell; and then get questioned by upper management when done incorrectly.

I have been with SW now for nearly 3 years and within the whole district there have only been a handful of Manager or Sales Rep job openings in which I could have applied for.  I applied and interviewed for two manager jobs and one rep job.  All of the potential promotions were also targeted by many other people who were both in and out of the district.  Needless to say, I was not given the promotions and was told different reasons why I didn't get the job for each by my District Manager.  Basically, there are not that many job openings in a given year, and the ones that are, have many people applying for it. One other thing about SW that bugs me is that during recruiting I was told that the management team was able to run their store pretty much the way they want to.  ""It is almost like running your own business.""  Is what the recruit told me.    That statement could not be further from the truth.  SW  has many rules and regulations passed down from the corporate headquarters.  Basic pay, store hours, inventory, selling events, pricing, margins, and several others business aspects are all pretty much controlled by SW corporate or district.  The main thing that bugs me is SW charges the stores 1% all the inventory they have at the end of each month.  This expense affects how your yearly numbers turn out.  Also, there is a major push by the District to keep inventory low.  However, frequently the stores are forced to take overstock items from the main distribution center.  No matter what the products are, the stores have to take these direct shipments, which most of the time are products that do not sell very well and the stores are stuck with them hitting their inventory numbers for months.","Promotions should go to the best applicant, not the one with the most tenure.",0,css-1areqgb,css-z2gtf,4,css-z2gtf,blank,positive,blank,6726,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sherwin-Williams-Reviews-E599.htm
