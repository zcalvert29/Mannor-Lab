From my experience within other industries and businesses if a company performs extremely well due to the great efforts of it's staff then those same staff can often look forward to a bonus of some sort. At Tesco there is no reward for great results. Unless you are a senior executive that is. Of course those billion dollar profits are all due to that merry bunch of executives at head office. 
It also has a very poor culture towards the health and safety of it's staff. In the warehouse fire doors can often be found blocked, Roll cages stacked with heavy stock will arrive for delivery with only 3 wheels where 4 should be and chiller floors covered with water making for highly dangerous working areas.

On Fridays and Saturdays there is an extra delivery which has to be worked (put on shelves) during the day, it is quite a hefty amount of stock to do when the store is so busy, around 25-35 roll cages full. Along with doing this which keeps you busy, you have plenty of customer queries to deal with and depending on whether you are multi-skilled or not you sometimes have to answer 'first class service' calls (much to your department managers annoyance) which means lending a hand on the checkouts during busy times. Getting 'multi-skilled' on the checkouts when you don't work on the checkout department is usually something you have to orchestrate yourself, I did it because there tends to be plenty of overtime opportunities on the checkouts as opposed to anywhere else, especially around Xmas. You do sometimes get till trained when you first start, it depends whether you work during busy times or not.","Any new vacancies in store are always advertised internally before employing new starters, and they have an internal course called 'Options' which trains you for a managers role, all the managers and team leaders at Tesco tend to have worked their way up, so if you are interested in a job at Tesco you are unlikely to be able to get straight into a managers role. This is good because it keeps current staff motivated to work hard, and to be honest if you want to work at Tesco and plan on settling there for a substantial period of time you need to be aiming for promotions.

- Book over a year in advance to take holidays in August, utterly ridiculous

- Jobs for the boys culture- your only chance of promotion is if you are mates with the department manager so many team leaders weren't there on merit and it showed.

- Different rules for checkout staff- you have to sign off your till at precisely the minute your break starts and be back on your till by the precise minute your break finishes (bear in mind that it is a good 5 minute walk to the canteen). You'd see folks from other departments congregating round the clock 5 mins before their shift finished. Just not fair at all.

They spend more time on thier phones or 'rumbling' essentially cleaning the shelves rather than actually working or managing, what they are effectively trained to do.. obv, my experieneces could be argued as rather opinionated. But on the face of it, when you first start it seems brilliant, give or take 6 months and you will start to uncover the underlying problems which will never go away. They dont care about thier staff and they never will.. One last thing which i find incredibly frustrating about this company.

10% staff discount card.

Holidays are quite generous.

Good number for students.

Work-life balance: able to go in, work your shift and go home after and forget about it. 

Training was good (if during your shift, it's like a little break and you get paid for it!)

Can be flexible (depending on the manager) if you want to swap a day/come in an hour early to get away an hour early. Sometimes this could be done which was good, but sometimes not.","The management culture - some of them are very nice don't get me wrong, but many of them are so uppity, and why? Get a grip - you're a manager in a department of a supermarket, you're not a big shot or something special by any stretch of the imagination. Seems to go to their heads. 

And it's not only the managers - some team leaders think they run the place!

If you work part time, depending on your hours, you're basically not allowed to be sick for more than a day a year. Disciplinary procedures, meetings and reviews if you have two days off in the space of six months.

They mess up pay WAY too much. Honestly, how can they mess up something so simple? Especially with clocking in and out! Then they make it ridiculously awkward and difficult to get it. They owed me £300 which I never got; I was asked to write down my hours, and I did this maybe 3 or 4 times, and when I queried it further - ""oh too much time has passed now"". It beggars belief. Especially as I KNOW that it's just a case of popping the hours into the computer. They either don't care, or can't be bothered. I expect a bit of both.

Ridiculous expectations. I worked on the home delivery department and you were expected to 'pick' at the speed of light and have 'blue/green' performance regardless of problems occasionally encountered, such as items not being on the shelves and having to trawl the warehouse to look for them. This can take a bit of time (all of 5/10 minutes) but surely it's worth finding the item the customer actually wants, even if it takes a little longer to finish? Customer is disregarded here... WORK FASTER! FASTER FASTER GO GO GO

... but unless the delivery van is revving waiting on you, which they never are, ever - I mean honestly, never ever has this happened :/ this is a complete non issue. Jobs-worth stuff for statistics that don't matter to anybody.

They can be short-staffed but won't provide the overtime, meaning the team are overworked and stressed. Home delivery often have to work beyond finish time to get finished just because they won't give other overtime.

The new CEO is great, really down to earth and approachable even when faced with severe problems.
There are great structured development programmes in place and you can progress rapidly if on one of these, (e.g. marketing graduate scheme 3 x 6 month placements then promoted to marketing manager) however despite the intended structure I know plenty of people including myself who have unfortunately not had the expected experience.
Because the business is so large there are lots of opportunities to get involved in extra things like community events, youth panels, women in business networks etc.
Generally people are open to new ideas although sometimes it can be very hard to make it happen due to wayyyyy too much red tape.
There is a very much a culture of meeting up with people to find out about their job roles over coffee- if you join as a grad I would do this as much as you can, it's pretty much expected.","-Probably down to the size of the business but sometimes it is hard to make an impact and too many internal processes can limit the speed that things can get done.

-I feel really let down by Tesco, admittedly they haven't been having the best time recently but I had to leave due to the fact I wasn't progressing as quickly as I need to (and that they promised when I joined on the graduate scheme)

-Also, my advice would be to stay away from HR as they hinder you rather than help you- it seems that the majority of promotions happen because a director has asked for a specific person, even though the company pride themselves on their development process. If you do ask HR for help, they will meddle and will also hide information from you. I think if you are going to have a process it should be followed by all so it's fairer and less confusing!

-If you don't join as a grad it's even harder to progress- you won't get on if you just do a good job, you have to prove yourself to directors and 'leave a legacy'.

-The social culture is pretty much non existant, everyone drives to work so you never go for drinks after work, and even if you wanted to the head office is in the back end of nowhere!

-It's a very formal and hierarchical culture although this may change following the recent restructure as they definitely need a more balanced mix of personalities. They talk about bringing your personality to work but I found it hard to do this most of the time, when you are comparing weekends with your team it's difficult to say that you went to a rave in a car park whilst they were out riding their horse or going to the Chelsea flower show.","Be more fair and transparent and treat people with more respect.

Everyone there is very friendly.","They are so disorganized, i never knew what was going on.
They don't pay for breaks, and they will try to make you work 9 hour shifts, do NOT do this.  You can work up to 8.75 hours with just 45 minutes of breaks, but if you work shifts between 9 and 11.75 hours, you have to have 1.5 hours of breaks.  So if you work 8.75 hour shifts, you get paid for 8 hours, whereas working a 9 hour shift only gets you 7.5 hours pay.  There is no way around this, you have to take all your breaks.  I should have researched this before I took the job, don't get tricked into this like I did.
They wanted me to start working, but I had to remind them they didn't have my right to work yet.
They didn't tell me you have to sign in at customer services as well as the team leader ticking your name, as a result i didn't get paid the right amount and had to spend over a month trying to get my money.
I gave my team leader a letter about parking fines that I received, she gave me a sticker to put in my car so the parking company knew I worked there and said she would sort out the current fines.  She forgot, as the management at this store seem to forget everything, so I gave another letter about a reminder, yet it still wasn't sorted out, and I had to make multiple calls to the car park company to finally get the fines sorted out.
I asked if I could stop working wednesdays, and the team leader told me to remind her again next week in case she forgot.  I reminded her twice and then she said she's going on holiday so it won't get sorted out for another two weeks at least.  This is when I left.  I'd have preferred her to simply tell me if it was something they couldn't do because of staff shortage, since I agreed to work those hours, so I would have stuck to them, but to string me along with no intention of changing my hours (or maybe she did really just keep forgetting) I think is unacceptable.
Often someone would tell me to find someone and help them with,, for example, shelves.  I didn't know anyone so had to identify them based on description, and when I found them they didn't know I was supposed to be helping them and had to waste time telling me what to do and where everything was since I hadn't done this before.  After all this I was called back to checkouts after not really doing anything, just getting in someone else's way.  They definitely could have better used our time by sending someone who actually knew what to do, or by telling me beforehand at a less busy time.","Be more organized.  The management team at the store where I worked were all very friendly, but they never seemed to get anything done.  They couldn't keep track of who was supposed to be working and other simple administrative tasks.  For example I had to phone up to get them to send me my payslip after I left, it was just sitting in the wages office or something.",0,3,1,3,1,negative,blank,neutral,19908,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Tesco-Reviews-E10250.htm,2

84,4.0,Current Employee,Limited review of Tesco Express Format by Colleague,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Tesco-RVW8348729.htm,"Oct 19, 2015",Customer Assistant,"Liverpool, England","Tesco has a diverse team of people from all walks of life. This makes us highly responsive to socio-political changes occurring through alternative viewpoints, religions, ideologies etc. There is a strong sense of belonging with Tesco staff across stores even with people you have never met before, we all fall under one badge so to speak. 

Tesco also has some great staff privileges which are greatly appreciated amongst the staff. As with social enterprises in the UK economy that cover government gaps to aid the general public, So too does Tesco cover gaps in government spending by offering discounts, deals, services to its employees to help them improve their living conditions.","Tesco has issues within its Express format, from what I can gather, Related to training. Systems in place are vaguely followed and much of the time is for ""audit"" purposes to get a ""green"" on an upcoming assessment. 

This lack of training has severe knock-on effects with operational functionality of the business, team cohesion, morale and even in times legality of the running of the business. Personally, I'd associate the problems with the need for new managers in a growing market (although slowing down comparative to what it used to be). 

There is also a family and friends culture within Tesco which makes it difficult to attain promotion unless you are 'favoured' to get a position. This goes with team leaders, deputies, managers and so on up the hierarchy. This makes our company very non-innovative or adaptive, limiting positions to people with social preference rather than talent or knowledge of the job.","To ground level management - There is great importance in training your staff to do their job effectively. Use the resources provided by the company to develop a strong and knowledgeable team. Your investment of time with these people will be greatly rewarded in how much they push themselves once they know the boundaries in which they operate. People are the best investment you can make.

Senior management - There needs to be a change in culture with hiring friends and family. There are great advantages to keeping friends and family together in our business but not when it comes to employee promotion or rewards. Area managers need to assess business individually, rather than relying on Audit results which can be skewered by 8-12weeks of good performance then 30+ weeks of average/poor performance. 

There also needs to be a definition between manager/deputy manager. From my experience, the two roles clash with differing ideologies and duties which makes it an ineffective practise. You would save more money having an administration ""team leader"" rather than a deputy manager. Redefinition of the roles would allow management to pinpoint failures in operations and make adjustments where necessary. 

My points are limited by a short service length comparative to some of your veterans, I just hope they are taken with the same amount of attention.",0,5,4,5,2,positive,positive,positive,19908,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Tesco-Reviews-E10250.htm,3

Fellow members of staff, whether they be people you work with or staff within other stores, you all will have a similar opinion on how working for Tesco can be.","The overtime can be little and far between, depends on the store that you work for, I have worked for 2 different stores so far and it purely depends on the time of year but also how much money your superiors are getting paid, some stores just don't have the money to pay their staff more for overtime. If you're working part-time and are ever off sick, you will most likely not be getting sick pay, Tesco seem to think that if you only work 10 hours a week you can clearly afford your rent if you're off sick for a long period of time especially if they don't pay you SP. 

Attendance is done by the percentage of shifts that you work in a week, rather than counting the days singularly. If you have only 2 shifts over a weekend and come down with a sickness bug (minimum of 48 hours after symptoms cease can you return) that is 100% of your hours in one week that you weren't able to work. Your attendance can become really low really fast if youre not careful!","Be more lenient to staff, there needs to be a different way to monitor attendance. One that is a lot more fair to those who only work a few hours in a week. A person does not get ill on purpose and when they get ill can not be controlled, regardless of the precautions they take.",0,3,4,1,2,positive,neutral,negative,19908,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Tesco-Reviews-E10250.htm,4

I've seen the way managers get treated on a regular basis and if that's the sort of life you could be living, it's no wonder, few people are interested. 

The senior team (at least in my store) seems to ignore most of the GA's and don't even acknowledge most of our existence, this is especially frustrating when (at least myself) have opened and quite clearly said ""hello"" to receive zero response, that is atrocious manners in anybodies book. Another gripe that bugs me is there really is that Divide between the managers and team, most noticeable during break times when they seem to congregate on their own table, and hardly even speaking to us commoners (at least that's how it seems)...

But will just add that 99% of staff and that includes all management except the odd 1 or 2 are all a great bunch it's really surprising how they all seem to know who you are (and nothing to do with name badges) even some of the night staff are great to get on with again including managers

But regarding a recent review""..I can't remember when...it was regarding the pay structure....about basic pay and extra time between 10pm and 6am....as you should all be fully aware of this....from July 3rd we will be receiving a pay rise...taking it to £7.62 per hour and the night premiums between 10pm and midnight are stopping and there's just one flat rate from 12am to 6am....night staff only....but time and half is staying for Sundays and bank holidays....the longer serving employees are losing their double time...some of which aren't happy....but the holiday pay structure is also changing and for those that regularly do overtime...as I do...will benefit by this....they will base your holiday pay on the hours you work the 12 weeks leading up to your holiday period....yes I'm losing out on the night premium between 10pm and 12am I can't really see there being any issue...we have also benefitted from the turnaround bonus of 5% of our annual earnings 2015/16 awarded in share bonus and can sell them straight away....unlike the shares in success where it has a holding period....I have seen a lot of people on the website having a mon up about the amount being less than their actual award amount etc but how I see it is...its money you wouldn't have had...anything is better than nothing right???
Throughout my time at Tesco...I have listened and heard other members of staff moaning about their managers etc and other managers...I will say that in almost 2 years I have never heard anyone have a moan up about my manager....he is a top bloke and does his job well....he is firm when he needs to be...he don't have a moan up for nothing...I am happy to be in the department I am and happy with other members of staff and management","Recently had a new store manager who I think is actually quite rude and arrogant....he has been in store whilst in have been on shift a few times and unlike when the new night manger started last year came round and introduced himself and had a chat with you....I have not heard from him once....to me that is not very good practice and definitely not a way a store manager should behave...he is meant to be the big boss man who wants a good reputation amongst his staff....this is definitely not the way to be going about it...you will definitely not be earning any respect from staff if you can't even acknowledge them....
Older members of staff have said he used to work in store before he made manager and is really nice....so far those that have come across him don't have the same opinion and I haven't seen anything nice so far....our old store manager was grest...always on shop floor getting involved and knew you by name as well....shame the same can't be said for the new one
Oh and another thing I have noticed....it's very family orientated....someone is related to someone or married to each other or parents and kids etc...a bit strange sometimes",Management need to ensure that all staff are aware of new management etc they also need to remember they were floor staff once upon a time perhaps even started out in warehouse as I think some of the managers did...,0,4,5,5,3,positive,positive,positive,19908,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Tesco-Reviews-E10250.htm,5
